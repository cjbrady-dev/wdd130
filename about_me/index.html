    <body>
    <p><b>Degree:</b> Software Engineering</p>
    <p><b>Hobbies:</b> I like to read Fantasy books like RuneLords, The Godling Chronicles, or Historical Fiction of any kind. I like to go to the gym. I Love to ride my bicycle in the summer.</p>
    <p><b>Family:</b> I am Married, no children only a fur baby named Daisy. Daisy is a mini GoldenDoodle.</p>
    <p><b>Employment:</b> I currently work as a Student Software Engineer Assistant.</p>
    <p><b>BYU-Idaho preferences/Degree type:</b> I love the student culture on campus, I just transferred from Western Governors University so I can attend BYU-I on campus again starting April. Online schooling has its perks but I miss being on campus. I am just getting a bachelors degree currently.</p>
    <p><b>Web Design:</b> I think having any knowledge is an advantage in this case the more I know about computers and how to manipulate them the better, I'm taking this course because it is required by my major, I want more practical project based experience with web design, the experience of more practical hands has a great worth in my current job and will in most Software Engineering jobs.</p>
    <p><b>Time as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ:</b> I'm 25 years old I have attended the church as long as I can remember but I guess as I was baptized at 8 years old I have been a member for 17 years. I love the whole book of Jacob in the book of mormon it is my favorite</p>
    <p><b>Shout Out:</b> Shout out to all you Lord of The Rings fans and DUNE fans!</p>
