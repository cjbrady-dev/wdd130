  <h1>
    Some of my own personal Expiriences.
  </h1>
  <p>
    My first language I learned during a mission I served for the Church of Jesus Christ of Later Day Saints! I served in the country of Brazil and learn how to speak Brazilian portugese. Once I finished my mission and returned home I had grown a tremendous love for learning languages and uncovering the unknown. I have found if you learn a language it helps you see through a diffrent set of eyes. If you live or surround yourself with the culture of the language you are learning, you may come to fall in love with the culture and people. Your life is inriched by this gift and ability to communicate in more than one language. I have learned a little of several languages, but German has been my second great project and the one language I know best after English and Portugese. I was inspired to learn German because of my love for history. I have studied much about the World Wars from the past. One thing I discovered was the ability to see beyond the common byisis of the judgment served on not only the past German people but the current. I was inspired by my love for the German people and understanding that they are worth knowing and they have a rich history, I dream of traveling there one day and touring the country and soaking up all I can about the people and culture. The best way to do that I have found from past expirience is to of course learn the language. I can't enjoy what I don't understand, and I think it is ashame more people don't have the desire to learn a language before visiting the place of origin. Because the people make that culture and if you can't interact with them it is a hollow expirience. I have been learning German for just over half a year now and am eager to share more about my expirence about it and what I wish I had known. I hope I can give some direction in your search for help and tools to learn this amazing language.
