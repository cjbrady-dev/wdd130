    I will suggest some intresting things, to you I think. I have often debated what is the best way to learn a language, and my number one answer to anyone will remain the same as I have come to the conclustion. I believe the best way to learn your language of choice is to go live in the country of origin or anywhere you can be surrounded completely by that language. You can't revert back to your normal primary language if you want to get good enough to be fluent in a diffrent language and quickly. It is an extreme route but also the most successful I have found. Though this is not always possible, so I will suggest a few other ideas for your learning german. You will need to open up to surrounding yourself with all you can that is German in speech. I'm talking people, music, books, movies anything German I have changed the primary language on some of my devices such as my laptop to be german, so everything on it is in German and not english. To get started though before doing this I would suggest that you find a class you can afford to meet with people and speak German together. Also download or subscribe to a App that is made for learning languages that include German. Such as "Babble", "DuoLingo" I have personally never had the privalige of using Babble but I have heard great things about it. I have often used Duolingo though, and I think it is a great opption for learning German. In addition to this, as you are learning german either with a class or on your own using an app. Start a journal of your own that is in just German. Practice your writing and reading in German on a daily basis and you will see dramatic improvement.
